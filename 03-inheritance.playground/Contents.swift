// Our game would be more fun with an Elf!
// Elf can both melee() and castSpell()

    // Needs to cast spells and melee...
}

// Elves cast spells and use swords?
// We can only inherit from one super class Spellcaster or Fighter, not both.

// The problems:

// You need to move castSpell and melee methods up to Player.
//      In this case we end up with classes that have more functionality than they need.
//      Fighters cast Spells and Wizards melee.

// Or, we make another subclass that casts spells and melees. 
//      In this case we duplicate functionality, more than one class casts spells
//      and melees.

// This is where inheritance breaks down. Moving all methods up the chain concentrates
// functionality in base classes. Making more sub classes often has us duplicating
// functionality.


// Wizard adds a new method
var mephisto = Wizard(name: "Mephisto")
mephisto.castSpell()

// Priest duplicates functionality
var clancy = Priest(name: "Clancy")
clancy.castSpell()

// Fighter
var frank = Fighter(name: "Frank")
frank.melee()

var elrond = Elf(name: "Elrond")
// ????


// - Challenge: 

// Define two protocols Casts, and Fights. Casts should define the castSpell() method. 
//  And, Fights should define the melee() method. 

// - Challenge: 

// Figher should inherit from Player, and adopt the Fights protocol. 
// Wizard should inherit from Player, and adopt the Casts protocol. 
// Elf should inherit from Player, and adopt both Casts and Fights. 

// - Challenge: 

// Fighter, Wizard, Priest, and Elf will need to implement the methods declared in the 
// protocols they adopt.
